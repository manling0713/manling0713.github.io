This is a research project for the Seminar on Business Statistics at National Taipei University. Some content may be in Chinese and translated. Feel free to contact me for more details!

## Business Problem
As the number of car accidents on highways in Taiwan is increasing, we aim to identify the contributing factors, including speed, traffic volume, and precipitation. By understanding these factors, we can propose effective methods to prevent such accidents from occurring in the future.

## Dataset
1. **Weather data** from the Central Weather Bureau
2. **Car Accidents data** from National Police Agency 
3. **Road section data** from Freeway Bureau (Sample size: 24 million)

## Tools
- Tools: R, SAS, Minitab
- Skills: Web Crawler, Principal Component Analysis(PCA), ANOVA, Paired-sample T-test, Chi-square test of Independence, Stepwise Logistic Regression
