Hi, I’m Queenie! I’m a Data Analyst with 3 years of experience leveraging SQL, Python, and R to transform complex datasets into actionable insights. I hold degrees in Statistics and Business Analytics, providing a strong foundation in data analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning, and A/B testing. Recently, I’ve incorporated AI and large language models (LLMs) into my analytics projects to enhance insights and efficiency.

Feel free to explore my collection of data projects. I look forward to connecting with you!
